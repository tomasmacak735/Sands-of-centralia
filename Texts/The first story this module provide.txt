The first story this module provides takes place in the year 2867 in a Centralian country called Matchastan, amidst a great economical and an increase in the regional tensions, players, as the agents of the newly established domestic intelligence/counter organised crime Department of the Ministry of truth aka the Internal Affairs Department, intervene in a violent museum robbery.
The players are then led to the underground crime ring connected to hostile nations military intelligence, which is operating from Matchastani soil in order to redevelop advanced military tech. Players (and the criminals) are then to learn that the critical component (a so called beacon core (a base for a future sci-fi magic system) in a pristine condition) is located in the ruins of the CERN research centre, Switzerland, on the ruins of which lies an independent buffer state between Matchastan and one of the hostile nations. 
But after a brief, but dangerous search the players discover that the entire canton of Geneva has switched places  with the city of Kampala, in a freak science accident. The players will then have to race for where Kampala should be (and CERN is)1 and then search through ancient ruins in order to get to the large collider and either obtain or destroy the core component for the ancient weapons, triggering different benefits to the players, acquisition of the component makes Matchastan the leader in advanced tech race, the destruction wins them a favour with a certain shadowy group focused on prevention of use of ancient weapons
